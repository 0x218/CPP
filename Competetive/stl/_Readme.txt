STL has 4 components: 
    Algorithms  - Sorting, searching
    Containers - 
        sequence contianers:- data structures that can be accessed in a squential manner
            Vector, List, Deque, Array, Forward_List
        container adaptors: provides different interface for a sequential containers
            Queue, Piority Queue, Stack
        Associative containers: implments sorted data struture that can be quikcly searched
            Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap.
        unordered assciative containers: implements unordered data structure tha can be quickly searched.
            unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap
    Functions - Functor
    Iterators.
